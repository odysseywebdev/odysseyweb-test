        <h2 class="main-about-heading">About Me</h2>
        <h4 class="main-about-text"><p>I'm Lewis, I am a freelance Front-End Web Designer/Developer. I'm based just outside of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. I attended Glasgow Clyde College for Web Engineering which I thoroughly enjoyed and I learned a lot during my time there. From how to use frameworks, version management, hosting, development, design, UI, UX, team management, the list feels endless.</p>

          <h2 class="main-about-heading">Why should you choose me?</h2>

          <h4 class="main-about-text"><p>There are many benefits to being Freelance, working for myself and being in total control of the end product and everything in-between and theres quite a few benefits for yourself. It means we can have a more personal relationship while working together. The level of communication from working with myself compared to an agency or a larger company (in my opinion cannot be beaten). I can have more time with yourself and keep you updated throughout the entire design and development process.</p>
          <p>I can help you. Sometimes we don’t always have exactly what we want in mind, it can be difficult to visualize and sometimes it can change over time. I am more than happy to work with you regarding the design side of things, and give my professional opinion and advice on what I think will work and what wont, but that's entirely up to yourself as ultimtely its your decision and your website. For example I can help choose out a certain color scheme, font or images that I think would meet your requirements.</p>
          <p>I can design what you need and make sure it looks modern and professional for your needs, nobody wants a site looking like its straight out of the 90’s...Right!? Whether you need a simple landing page or a product release page or you're the owner of a cafe,restraunt or bar? Maybe you even run a small business and require a site to market yourself to potential clients? I am here to help.</h4>
