    <h4 class="help">I'm Lewis, a Freelance Front-End Web Designer and Online Store Owner </a>from Glasgow, Scotland.<p>Feel free to take a look around and contact me if you're interested in what I offer!</p></h4>
  </div>
      <div class="middle-container">
        <h2 class="main-about-heading">About Me</h2>
        <h4 class="main-about-text"><p>I'm Lewis, I am a freelance Front-End Web Designer/Developer. I'm based just outside of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. I attended Glasgow Clyde College for Web Engineering which I thoroughly enjoyed and I learned a lot during my time there. From how to use frameworks, version management, hosting, development, design, UI, UX, team management, the list feels endless. Learning outside of college has also been crucial step to furthering my skill set, self studying has been great although not without its challenges.</p>

          <h2 class="main-about-heading">Why should you choose me?</h2>

          <h4 class="main-about-text"><p>There are many benefits to being Freelance, working for myself and being in total control of the end product and everything in-between and theres quite a few benefits for yourself. It means we can have a more personal relationship while working together. The level of communication from working with myself compared to an agency or a larger company (in my opinion cannot be beaten). I can have more time with yourself and keep you updated throughout the entire design and development process.</p>
          <p>I can help you. Sometimes we don’t always have exactly what we want in mind, it can be difficult to visualize and sometimes it can change over time. I am more than happy to work with you regarding the design side of things, and give my professional opinion and advice on what I think will work and what wont, but that's entirely up to yourself as ultimtely its your decision and your website. For example I can help choose out a certain color scheme, font or images that I think would meet your requirements.</p>
          <p>I can design what you need and make sure it looks modern and professional for your needs, nobody wants a site looking like its straight out of the 90’s...Right!? Whether you need a simple landing page or a product release page or you're the owner of a cafe,restraunt or bar? Maybe you even run a small business and require a site to market yourself to potential clients? I am here to help.</h4>
